# A Ray Tracer following the RTIOW Series!

This repository holds my progress as I go through the [*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*](https://raytracing.github.io) series of books.

One difference in my implementation so far is that I'm using [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for vectors rather than the book's `vec3` class.

Stay tuned for more updates! :)
